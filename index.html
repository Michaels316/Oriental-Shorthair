            <h3>History Of The Oriental Shorthair Breed</h3>
            <p>Oriental Shorthair Cat For Sale. Although it's simple to picture these majestic, statuesque cats mingling with Cleopatra, Oriental shorthairs are a very recent breed. English breeders started combining Siamese with other house cats in the 1950s, which is when they first appeared (due to the decline of Siamese cats after World War II). According to the CFA Oriental Breed Council, the origin of the first Oriental shorthair cats can be linked to Russian blues and black hybrids, which are full black cats with both Siamese and non-Siamese ancestry. Siamese cats persisted in being crossed with various breeds, giving rise to so many eye-catching hues and patterns that each was thought to be a distinct breed in its own right. But soon there were so many distinctive colors and patterns that the cats were categorized into just one breed—the Oriental shorthair.
                Oriental shorthairs didn't arrive in the UK until the 1970s, but they quickly became popular. The popularity of the Oriental shorthair skyrocketed in the United States only a few years after it arrived. In 1977, the Cat Fanciers' Association granted them recognition.</p>

        <div class="course-col">
            <h3>Oriental Shorthair Cat Care</h3>
            <p>Due to their simpler coats, Oriental shorthair cats may be more popular than their longhaired cousins. Regular brushing will highlight that beautiful coat and lessen seasonal shedding. The best in a cat's coat is also brought out by the odd bath or wipe-down.
  Their large ears require the most maintenance, not their short fur. You should check for wax and anything strange once a week. However, in most cases, a few drops of warm water on a cotton ball can be sufficient to gently swab those bat-like ears clean. Your veterinarian can lead you through the process of preferred ear cleaning procedures. Oriental Shorthair For Sale. Because of his fine coat, the Oriental shorthair requires less care than his Oriental longhair cousin. Additionally, Oriental shorthairs typically live longer than other big-eared breeds; it's not unusual for them to live above 15 years.
  Oriental shorthairs are not as uncommon as unique cat breeds like the Khoa Manee or American Bobtail, despite the fact that their appearance is odd and many people may not be familiar with these felines.</p>

            <h3>Characteristics Of The Oriental Shorthair Cat Breed</h3>
            <p>TAre you up for a conversation? An Oriental shorthair is usually chatty and has a peculiar cry that is sometimes referred to as a honk. According to Keiger, "They talk when they need something, want to know what's happening, what you're doing, or where you are."
                These cats are highly gregarious creatures, as you might surely infer. Oriental shorthair cats are intelligent and loving creatures who enjoy spending time with their families and other pets, especially other cats. They frequently serve as your second shadow and are complete "Velcro kitties." As a result of their intense attachment to you, they will follow you everywhere you go in your house.
                Although they are not the type of lap cat to lounge around all day watching the world go by due to their moderate energy levels, they will definitely look for that lap when the mood strikes. These cats are equally squishy and active. The Oriental cat is not only gorgeous but also quite smart. She's trainable to follow a lead when walking. However, this does not imply that she can be educated to carry out all of your wishes. The Oriental has her own desires, just like the majority of other extremely intellectual breeds.
                The Oriental cat is a loving breed that needs a parent who will devote as much time to her as she does to her. The parent must show the Oriental Shorthair affection and spend time playing with her.</p>
